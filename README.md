### Course Objectives
- Practical introduction to NLP using real world examples and tasks.
- Learn basic linguistic concepts (e.g., Morphology, Syntax, Semantics, Pragmatics).
- Introduce methods that make language accessible to computers from different levels (e.g., Word, Phrase / Group, Sentence / Clause, Text / Discourse).
- Apply NLP techniques to a variaty of real world text analysis tasks (e.g., Part-Of-Speech Tagging, Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition, Information Extraction).
